Ingres-Utility-IIMonitor version 0.1

This module provides an API to the iimonitor utility for
Ingres RDBMS, which provides local control of IIDBMS servers
and sessions (system and user conections).

To use this module, the current user should be the Ingres
installation owner, usually "ingres", to have rights to
use all features.

Environment variables (II_SYSTEM et ali) should be set also.

Through this interface, it is possible to obtain a list of all
registered services, for later processing (eg. iimonitor).
